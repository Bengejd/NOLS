# RSO: Responsive SCSS Optimizer
RSO makes writing responsive SCSS easier by taking the hassle out of converting pixel `px` values to viewport `vh/vw` 
values within your project with one simple CLI command.

## Project Status
RSO is currently in development and **NOT RECOMMENDED** for production use at this time. 

# TODO: 

- [ ] Add --clean CLI argument (will remove all comments that RSO adds, but also makes it so you cannot revert 
changes.)

- [ ] Add --revert CLI argument (will revert all RSO changes, detected by comments in .scss files.)

- [ ] Add optional CLI arguments (--clean, --revert)

- [X] Unit tests as much as possible

- [ ] Create more manual file tests

- [ ] Include JSDocs for all utility functions

- [ ] Hookup TravisCLI

- [ ] Package for NPM

- [ ] Fix up readMe

- [ ] Optimize project code
