# RSO: Responsive SCSS Optimizer
A superb CLI tool that converts your SCSS files from pixel (px) values to viewport (vh/vw).

## Project Status
RSO is currently in development and **NOT RECOMMENDED** for production use at this time. 

## Why RSO
RSO makes writing responsive SCSS easier by taking the hassle out of converting pixel `px` values to viewport `vh/vw` 
values within your project with one simple CLI command.
