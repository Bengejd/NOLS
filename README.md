# RSO: Responsive SCSS Optimizer
RSO makes writing responsive SCSS easier by taking the hassle out of converting pixel `px` values to viewport `vh/vw` 
values within your project with one simple CLI command.

## Project Status
RSO is currently in development and **NOT RECOMMENDED** for production use at this time.
